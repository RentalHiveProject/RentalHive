# 🐝 RentalHive

**RentalHive** is a decentralized property rental marketplace powered by smart contracts and NFTs. Tenants and landlords interact through a transparent escrow system where deposits are securely locked until the rental period ends. Listings, bookings, and deal statuses are managed on-chain, with NFT rental agreements and DAO-based reputation systems protecting all parties from fraud.
